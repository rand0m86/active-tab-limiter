= Active Tab Limiter

Chrome extension which keeps you concentrated by closing the tabs if their amount 
is bigger than some preconfigured value.

Also current implementation allows to configure such parameters as:

* Amount of opened tabs per browser window. Defaults to `3`.
* Order of closing the tabs (close old or recent tabs first). Defaults to `Old tabs first`.
* Ignore pinned tabs. Will not close pinned tabs and will not calculate them for the total tabs limit.
